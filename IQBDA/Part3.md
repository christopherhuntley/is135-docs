# IQBDA Part 3: HTML Forms

## Objectives
* Create a basic form from scratch
* Learn about form elements and labels
* learn about URL data encoding

**1. Add the new `member.html` page.**
  * Create a blank `member.html` file.
  * Add a navigation link for the `member.html` file to the navbar menus in the `iqbdc.html` and`index.html` files. The link text should be “Become a Member”.

  * Near the bottom of the `index.html` file there is a link in the content that is supposed to refer to the `member.html` file. Update the link to point to the new file and take out the `onclick` attribute that has the javascript popup message.
  * Use the ‘template’ for the `member.html` file. Follow the same technique we used in Part 2  to reuse the `index.html` code for everything except the main page content.
  * Give the `member.html` a `header` with the headline “Join IQBDA Today!”. (Look at how we did that in Part 2. Be consistent!)
  * Close the `index.html` and `iqbdc.html` files. The rest of this exercise will focus just on the new `member.html` file.

**2. Create the required form elements.**
  * Create a `form` element that submits results as a post to *your email address*.
    >If you don’t know how to create email URLs or how to specify `post` instead of `get`, then please refer to your book! It’s both a textbook and a reference.
  * Add the following fields to the form:

| Field Name | Label | Control Type | Options |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------- |
| name | Name | text | |
| pass | Password | password | |
| pass2 | Password (again) | password | |
| email | Email | email| |
| photo | Photo | file | |
| address | Mailing Address | textarea| |
| iqbdc98 | Do you plan to attend IQBDC ‘98? | radio | “Y”,”N” |
| channel | How did you hear about us? | select | "Superbowl Ad", "News Article", "Email", "Flyover at the beach" |

  A few tips:
  * **Don't wrap the form fields in list elements** as you may have seen done in the textbook. There are better ways to organize them that we will explore in another exercise. For now, just worry about how the fields operate, not what they look like or how they are organized.
  * Each field should have a `label` element. Whenever possible use explicit labeling, where the `for` attribute of the `label` element matches the `id` attribute of the input.
  * Labels for `radio` controls are handled a little differently from the rest. Each option (“Yes” or “No”) should have its own `label` (attached explicitly). In addition, the question “How did you …” is also a `label`, but don’t attach it to anything; just use a `label` element without a `for` attribute. If you try to use implicit labeling as described in the book you will actually get a bug.
  * Don’t forget to add a submit button to the bottom of the form.

**3. Do a little temporary formatting.**
* Preview your page. The form should look like this:

  Notice how all the fields show up on one line? That’s because form inputs are inline elements. We can change that with CSS, but for now just add a `<br>` to the end of each field.  
* Preview again. After adding the line breaks the page should look like this:
  ![](images/part3s3b.png)
  It's not pretty, but at least it isn't a jumble of fields.

**4. Test and debug your form.**
  * Open your file in a web browser. You can get the URL of the file by right-clicking on it in the right-hand panel in Atom and selecting "copy full path".
  > Why test the page in a web browser instead of the Atom previewer? Because you always want to test your pages in the same software your users will be using. In this case that's a web browser.

  * Click on each of your labels. When you click on a label, the focus (i.e., the cursor) should jump to the corresponding input element. If it doesn't then there is a bug.

  You’ve got three possible bugs to look for. The first is that the `for` and `id` attributes don’t match when using explicit labeling. The second is that you closed the `label` too soon when using implicit labeling (which you shouldn’t be using anyway). The last possibility is that you didn’t use a `label` for each radio button.

  * Enter some data in your form and submit it.

    *If you set up your default email client on your computer* then submitting the form will open up a new email with a string of characters inside. This is a *query string* like the ones described by the book. That's actually the message that the webserver would have received if we had set the form `action` to a web URL instead of an email URL.
