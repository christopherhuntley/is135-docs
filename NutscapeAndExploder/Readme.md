# Nutscape & Exploder
> In this tutorial we will return to the earliest days of the Web, working with anhtient HTML from Mosaic Communications, a true web pioneer. Netscape Communications released the first commercial web browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. By mid-year the company had what was then the biggest IPO in history, in the process kicking off the DotCom bubble. Microsoft released its browser, Internet Explorer the next year, bringing the Web to millions of Windows 95 users.

> While an exciting time for the web, the 1990s were a pretty turbulent time for web designers. HTML was in active development, with even basic things like the HEAD and BODY tags still non-standard. For that matter, CSS did not exist until late in the decade, with about 6 years-worth of mal-formed HTML pages “out there” to content with. The result was that neither of the popular browsers of the time were especially beloved. Developers had pet names for each, based on which one worked (or more often, didn’t work) with their pages. The title of this exercise pays homage to these web pioneers and the names they gave to their browsers.
