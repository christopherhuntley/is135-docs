# StagUp Bootstrap Preliminaries

## Objectives
* Study the Bootstrap documentation
* Browse through some examples

**1. Open the [Bootstrap docs](http://getbootstrap.com) and take a look around.**

   Developed and maintained by the front-end engineers at Twitter, the Bootstrap framework is a bunch of pre-built (and tested!) CSS and Javscript code that we can use in our projects. Bootstrap has become very popular with web designers for its simplicity and huge feature set. Bootstrap 3 is the current production release, with version 4 (currently in alpha) expected sometime in early 2017. We will be using version 3 though we might take a peek at version 4 once it’s closer to a production release.

   > When terms like 'alpha' and 'beta' are applied to software, it means that it is not yet ready to be used for anything that absolutely has to work. 'Alpha' software is the least 'mature,' with lost of bugs and likely a bunch of missing features. 'Beta' software is more mature, with fewer bugs but not yet ready for 'production' use by the general public. There is actually a lot more to this stuff, but the more subtle differences between 'alpha,' 'beta,' and 'production' are irrelevant for our purposes. Ask if you'd like to know more about software release management.

  The documentation are organized into several pages, each of which covers a different kind of *feature*:
  * **Getting Started**  
    A collection of themes, boilerplate HTML pages, and tools that make getting started really easy.
  * **CSS**  
    A very large set of CSS classes that can used to add style to just about any HTML. So, for example, if you want to make an HTML link look like a button then just add `class=”btn btn-default”` to the link:

    ```html
    <a href=”#” class=”btn btn-default”>some link text</a>
    ```

    Probably the most useful of all the CSS classes are used in the grid system, which allows us to organize content into rectangular regions that fit together nicely and even grow/shrink to fit the page width.
  * **Components**  
    A collection of reusable user interface elements (i.e., “components") that can make assembling even very complex pages fairly painless. Each component combines specially-structured HTML with accompanying CSS classes that control what everything looks like. For example, there is a special **nav** component that can be used to create menus of items and then style them to look like buttons, tabs, etc. There is even a **jumbotron** component for creating an Apple-style huge product image for the top of your website.
  * **Javascript**  
    A collection of components that also require javascript be enabled in order to function. This is where you would find image carousels, dropdowns, accordions, and other fanciness that add specialized behavior to your pages. These are often the "enhancements" provided through progressive enhancement.
  * **Customize**   
    Not exactly a feature of the *framework*, this page is a feature of the Bootstrap *website*. You can download highly customized copies of Bootstrap that eliminate features you don’t need. Using a lean, barebones copy of Bootstrap can make your pages load faster.

Take some time to play with the features. There is really is a lot to work with and *you don't need to design,build, or test  any of it yourself*. After all, why reinvent the wheel unless you really intend to build a better wheel.

**2. Explore the Expo.**  
Browse through some of the finished [websites in the  Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com). You’ll find Spotify, Newsweek, and lots of other big media sites, but there are also a lot of sites for smaller companies, nonprofits, and even a few universities. None of them look bad, some even look very good! Underneath they are all Bootstrap just the same. And Bootstrap is 100% free.
