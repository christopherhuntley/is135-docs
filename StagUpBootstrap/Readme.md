# The StagUp Bootstrap Project
>This project is designed to step through the basics of using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework. You will build a simplified version of the [Fairfield StartUp](http://fairfieldstartup.fairfield.edu) website, which was originally called Fairfield StagUp but had to be renamed at the request of the Athletics department.

* [Preliminaries](Preliminaries.md)
